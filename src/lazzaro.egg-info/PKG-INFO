# Lazzaro

**Scalable Memory System Library for AI Agents**

Lazzaro is a Python library that provides AI agents with long-term, scalable, and structured memory. Moving beyond simple vector databases, Lazzaro implements a graph-based memory architecture featuring semantic sharding, hierarchical clustering, and biological-inspired decay. It simulates human memory by maintaining an active context buffer, consolidating interactions into persistent structures, and evolving a multi-domain user profile.

## Installation

Install the core library:

```bash
pip install lazzaro
```

### Optional Dependencies

Enable specific providers or features:

*   **Google Gemini**: `pip install google-generativeai`
*   **Together AI**: `pip install together`
*   **LangChain**: `pip install langchain-core`
*   **Autogen**: `pip install pyautogen`
*   **Visualization**: `pip install matplotlib plotly`

## Core Architecture

Lazzaro manages memory through a multi-layered graph system.

### 1. Memory Shards (Topic-Based Isolation)
Unlike traditional database sharding by ID, Lazzaro shards memories semantically. Each `MemoryShard` acts as an independent subgraph containing nodes and edges related to a specific topic (e.g., "coding", "personal health", "travel").
*   **Shard Inference**: When new facts are extracted, Lazzaro uses an LLM to categorize them into existing or new shards.
*   **Retrieval Heuristic**: To maintain low latency, Lazzaro prioritizes recently accessed shards and those with higher node density for initial search.

### 2. The Buffer Graph
The `BufferGraph` manages the global state of all shards and super-nodes. It handles:
*   **Node Integrity**: Maintaining content, embeddings, salience, and access metrics.
*   **Edge Weighting**: Tracking the strength of associations between memories based on co-occurrence and semantic similarity.

### 3. Hierarchical Clustering (Super-Nodes)
When a shard grows beyond a configurable threshold, Lazzaro creates "Super-Nodes". These are synthetic nodes that represent the aggregate content of a cluster.
*   **Accelerated Search**: Retrieval begins at the super-node level to quickly narrow down relevant subgraphs.
*   **Abstract Reasoning**: Super-nodes allow agents to access high-level summaries of broad topics without loading every individual memory.

## The Memory Lifecycle

### Stage 1: Short-Term Buffer
Every interaction (user message and assistant response) is initially cached in a short-term episodic buffer. This provides immediate context for the current conversation.

### Stage 2: Asynchronous Consolidation
Lazzaro runs a multi-stage background process to move buffer data into long-term storage:
1.  **Atomic Fact Extraction**: An LLM extracts discrete facts from the conversation stream.
2.  **Deduplication**: New facts are compared against existing nodes in the target shard. If a match is found (cosine similarity > 0.95), the existing node's salience and access count are boosted instead of creating a duplicate.
3.  **Graph Linking**: New nodes are linked to each other (episodic link) and to semantically related existing nodes (associative link).
4.  **Profile Update**: Relevant facts are used to refine the multi-domain User Profile.

### Stage 3: Temporal Decay and Pruning
Lazzaro prevents memory bloat through biological-inspired pruning:
*   **Sigmoidal Decay**: Node salience and edge weights decrease over time. The decay follows a non-linear curve that flattens at 0.2, ensuring important memories persist longer while weak associations fade.
*   **Weak Edge Pruning**: Edges with weights falling below a threshold (default 0.5) are automatically removed.
*   **Buffer Enforcement**: If the total node count exceeds `max_buffer_size`, the system archives the least salient nodes to maintain performance.

## User Profile Evolution

Lazzaro maintains a structured `Profile` across five key domains:
*   **Preferences**: Specific likes, dislikes, and technical choices.
*   **Personality Traits**: The user's observed demeanor and values.
*   **Knowledge Domains**: Areas where the user exhibits expertise or deep interest.
*   **Interaction Style**: How the user prefers to communicate (e.g., concise, formal, technical).
*   **Key Experiences**: Significant life events or project milestones.

Updates occur during consolidation, where an LLM synthesizes new interactions into existing profile fields.

## Retrieval Engine

Retrieval is optimized for both speed and relevance:
*   **Shard Selection**: Only the most relevant shards are searched based on the query.
*   **Hybrid Search**: Combines cosine similarity of embeddings with recency weighting and salience scores.
*   **Associative Boosting**: When a node is retrieved, its immediate neighbors in the graph receive a temporary "accessibility boost," pulling related memories into the current context.
*   **Query Caching**: Frequent queries are cached to minimize LLM and embedding overhead.

## Usage

### Provider Configuration

```python
from lazzaro.core.memory_system import MemorySystem
from lazzaro.core.providers import GeminiLLM, GeminiEmbedder

# Initialize providers
llm = GeminiLLM(api_key="API_KEY", model="gemini-1.5-flash")
embedder = GeminiEmbedder(api_key="API_KEY")

# Initialize Memory System
ms = MemorySystem(
    llm_provider=llm, 
    embedding_provider=embedder,
    enable_sharding=True,
    enable_hierarchy=True,
    max_buffer_size=100
)

# Chat with built-in memory retrieval
ms.start_conversation()
response = ms.chat("I'm working on a Rust project and I prefer using async-std.")
print(response)

# Finalize and trigger background consolidation
print(ms.end_conversation())
```

### Visual Dashboard (Premium)

For a high-fidelity, interactive experience, Lazzaro includes a custom web-based dashboard:

```bash
lazzaro-dashboard
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5299` and features:
*   **Live Force-Graph**: Interactive visualization of your memory shards and node relationships.
*   **Real-time Metrics**: Monitor LLM calls, embedding costs, and retrieval latency.
*   **Profile Explorer**: View your evolved user persona domains in a sleek side drawer.
*   **Direct Chat**: Interact with Lazzaro and watch the graph evolve as memories are consolidated.

### Integrations

#### LangChain
```python
from lazzaro.integrations import LazzaroLangChainMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

memory = LazzaroLangChainMemory(memory_system=ms)
chain = ConversationChain(llm=chat_model, memory=memory)
```

#### LangGraph
```python
from lazzaro.integrations import LazzaroLangGraph

lg = LazzaroLangGraph(ms)
builder.add_node("retrieve", lg.get_memory_node())
builder.add_node("record", lg.get_record_node())
```

## CLI Reference

Launch the interactive shell:
```bash
lazzaro-cli
```
